Extension Points

 If you gave Groovy Dice a try but it turned out to not fit your needs, you can
 use one of Groovy Dice's extension points to fix the issues you found.

 Currently, there are two ways to customize Groovy Dice:

    [[1]] Provide your own {{{number_generator.html}random number generator}};

    [[2]] Provide new {{{plugins.html}plugins}} to replace or extend the built-in API.
