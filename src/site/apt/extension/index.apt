Extension Points

 If you gave Groovy Dice a try but it turned out not to fit your needs, then you
 can use the extension points to workaround the issues you found.

 There are two ways to customize Groovy Dice:

    [[1]] Provide your own {{{number_generator.html}random number generator}}

    [[2]] Provide new {{{plugins.html}plugins}} to replace or extend the built-in API
